README:
Compile the program as follows:
      gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies main.c
      ./movies movies_sample_1.csv

The program will then prompt you a selection of question which will read an input between 1-4. From there the program will either display all
movies made within that year, the highest ranking movie per year, or the movies with the language option desired. The last option (4) will
exit the program.
